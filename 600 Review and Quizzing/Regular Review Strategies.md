Regular review is essential to learning and retaining new knowledge in Spanish. Here are some strategies you can use to make your review more effective:

## Spaced Repetition
Review new words or grammar rules after increasing intervals of time. For example, review new information after one day, then three days, then a week, and so on.  Using SRS apps, such as Anki or even physical flashcards can be a great help for retention of vocabulary.

## Mixed Practice
Rather than focusing on one type of exercise (such as verb conjugations), mix different types of exercises (such as vocabulary, grammar, listening, and reading) in your review sessions.

## Active Recall
Try to remember information without looking at the answers. For example, instead of reading a list of vocabulary and their meanings, look at the Spanish words and try to recall their meanings.

## Teaching Others
Teaching what you've learned to others can help reinforce your understanding and memory of the information. You can do this in a study group or online forum.

## Regular Use
Try to use Spanish in your daily life as much as possible. This could involve speaking, reading, writing, or listening to Spanish.

Remember, review is most effective when it's done regularly and in a focused manner. Even short, focused review sessions can significantly improve your retention of Spanish.
