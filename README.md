# SpanishLanguageLearning
An Obsidian vault for studying the Spanish language.

This vault was created as a basic study space for learning the Spanish language.  It includes multiple vocabulary lists and notes explaining different grammar points.

Start by adding new definition notes - the vocabulary lists have the words pre-linked, so all you have to do is click them to add a new one.

There are also templates for definition notes for each type of word (noun, verb, adverb, etc.) so all you have to do is insert your template, and then fill it out for the wordthat you're creating a note for.

This template was developed for Spanish learners based on the vault I've created for myself as a study space while I learn Mandarin Chinese.

Don't be afraid to make your version work for you, adding new vocabulary lists and resources to enhance your study plans.
