In Spanish, the level of formality you use in your speech changes depending on who you're talking to. It's important to use the appropriate level of formality to show respect and maintain good relationships.

## Informal Speech

Informal speech (tú form) is used when speaking with friends, family, children, animals, and anyone else with whom you have a close or informal relationship. This form is more casual.

For example:
- "¿Cómo estás?" (How are you? - informal)

## Formal Speech

Formal speech (usted form) is used when speaking with elders, superiors, in professional settings, or with anyone you don't know well or want to show respect to. This form is more polite and respectful.

For example:
- "¿Cómo está usted?" (How are you? - formal)

## Regional Variations

In some regions, especially in parts of Latin America, "vos" is used instead of "tú" for informal speech. The conjugation for "vos" is slightly different, so it's important to learn the specific rules if you're going to be speaking Spanish in these regions.

Recognizing when to use formal or informal speech is a crucial part of communicating effectively in Spanish. Keep practicing both forms to become comfortable switching between them.
