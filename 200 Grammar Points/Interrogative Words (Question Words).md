Interrogative words, also known as question words, are used to ask questions in Spanish. They are essential for gaining information and engaging in conversation. Here are the main interrogative words in Spanish:

- `¿Qué?` (What?)
- `¿Quién?` (Who?)
- `¿Con quién?` (With whom?)
- `¿Por qué?` (Why?)
- `¿Cuándo?` (When?)
- `¿Dónde?` (Where?)
- `¿Adónde?` (To where?)
- `¿De dónde?` (From where?)
- `¿Cómo?` (How?)
- `¿Cuánto/a?` (How much?)
- `¿Cuántos/as?` (How many?)

Note that Spanish uses inverted question marks (¿) at the beginning of a question. Also, unlike English, Spanish often does not invert the subject and the verb in a question. 

For example:
- "¿Cómo estás tú?" (How are you?)
- "¿Cuándo viene ella?" (When is she coming?)

Remember that while English often uses "do" or "does" to start a question, Spanish generally does not have an equivalent construction.
