Spanish is a phonetic language, meaning words are generally pronounced the way they are spelled. This makes pronunciation more straightforward compared to some other languages.

## Vowels

Spanish has five vowel sounds, which are shorter and more precise than in English:

- `a` is pronounced like the 'a' in 'father'
- `e` is pronounced like the 'e' in 'bed'
- `i` is pronounced like the 'ee' in 'see'
- `o` is pronounced like the 'o' in 'hope'
- `u` is pronounced like the 'oo' in 'boot'

## Consonants

Most consonants are pronounced similarly to their English counterparts with a few notable exceptions:

- `h` is always silent unless it follows a 'c', in which case 'ch' is pronounced like 'ch' in 'chair'
- `j` is pronounced like the 'h' in 'house'
- `ll` and `y` are pronounced like the 'y' in 'yes'
- `ñ` is pronounced like 'ny' in 'canyon'
- `v` is pronounced more like the English 'b', but with the lips not touching
- `z` and `c` (before 'i' or 'e') are pronounced like 'th' in 'think' in Spain and like 's' in most Latin American countries
- `rr` is a rolled 'r', a sound not present in English

## Stress and Accents

Words in Spanish are usually stressed on the penultimate (second to last) syllable. However, if a word is stressed on a different syllable, it will have an accent mark over the vowel of the stressed syllable, such as in the word 'rápido'.

These are basic pronunciation rules and there can be regional variations. Listening to Spanish speakers and practicing out loud is the best way to improve your pronunciation.
