The subjunctive mood in Spanish is used to express various states of unreality such as doubt, possibility, necessity, and action that have not yet occurred. 

## When to Use

The subjunctive is used in various situations, including:

- Expressing desires: "Espero que tú vengas" (I hope that you come)
- Giving advice: "Es mejor que tú estudies" (It's better that you study)
- Talking about the future: "Cuando seas mayor" (When you are older)

## How to Conjugate

The formation of the subjunctive is based on the yo form of the present indicative. The endings change as follows:

- For -ar verbs: e, es, e, emos, éis, en
- For -er and -ir verbs: a, as, a, amos, áis, an

For example:
- hablar (to speak): hable, hables, hable, hablemos, habléis, hablen
- comer (to eat): coma, comas, coma, comamos, comáis, coman
- vivir (to live): viva, vivas, viva, vivamos, viváis, vivan

## Irregularities

Some verbs are irregular in the subjunctive, like `ser` (to be), `ir` (to go), `saber` (to know), and `haber` (to have).
