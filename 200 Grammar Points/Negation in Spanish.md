In Spanish, negation is the process of making a sentence or phrase negative. Here are some basic rules and tips for forming negative sentences in Spanish:

## Basic Negation

The most basic form of negation in Spanish is adding `no` before the verb.

For example:
- "Yo hablo" (I speak) becomes "Yo no hablo" (I do not speak)

## Double Negatives

Spanish uses double negatives in a way that is not typically seen in English. In Spanish, once a sentence is negative, all other elements must be negative as well.

For example:
- "No veo a nadie" (I don't see anyone)
- "No hago nada" (I don't do anything)

## Negative Words

There are many words in Spanish that can be used to form negative sentences, including:

- `nunca` (never)
- `nadie` (nobody)
- `nada` (nothing)
- `ninguno/a` (none, not any)
- `jam√°s` (never)
- `ni` (nor)

These words usually go after the verb if there is no `no` before the verb, or before the verb if there is a `no`.

For example:
- "Nunca hablo" (I never speak)
- "No hablo nunca" (I never speak)
- "Nadie habla" (Nobody speaks)
- "No habla nadie" (Nobody speaks)
