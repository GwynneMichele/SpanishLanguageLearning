In Spanish, as in English, sentences often contain direct and indirect objects. The direct object receives the action of the verb directly, while the indirect object is who or what the action is performed for. 

## Direct Objects

Direct objects answer the question 'what?' or 'whom?' after a verb. For example, in the sentence "Yo leo el libro" (I read the book), "el libro" is the direct object of the verb "leo" (read).

Direct object pronouns can replace the direct object noun. They agree in gender and number with the noun they replace.

- `lo` (him, it, masculine singular)
- `la` (her, it, feminine singular)
- `los` (them, masculine plural)
- `las` (them, feminine plural)

## Indirect Objects

Indirect objects answer the question 'to whom?' or 'for whom?' the action of the verb is done. For example, in the sentence "Yo le doy el libro a Juan" (I give the book to Juan), "Juan" is the indirect object of the verb "doy" (give).

Indirect object pronouns can replace the indirect object noun. They are:

- `me` (to/for me)
- `te` (to/for you informal singular)
- `le` (to/for him, her, it, you formal singular)
- `nos` (to/for us)
- `os` (to/for you informal plural)
- `les` (to/for them, you formal plural)

## Important Note

When a pronoun takes the place of the name of the direct or indirect object, it is placed before the conjugated verb or attached to the infinitive, gerund, or command.

Examples:
- "Lo veo" (I see him/it).
- "Voy a verlo" (I am going to see him/it).
- "Viéndolo" (Seeing him/it).
- "Véalo" (See him/it - formal command).
