Articles are small words that go before nouns. Spanish has definite articles (equivalent to "the" in English) and indefinite articles (equivalent to "a", "an", and "some" in English).

## Definite Articles

Definite articles are used to talk about specific items, people, or concepts. The definite articles in Spanish are:

- `el` for singular, masculine nouns (el libro - the book)
- `la` for singular, feminine nouns (la manzana - the apple)
- `los` for plural, masculine nouns (los libros - the books)
- `las` for plural, feminine nouns (las manzanas - the apples)

## Indefinite Articles

Indefinite articles are used to talk about non-specific items, people, or concepts. The indefinite articles in Spanish are:

- `un` for singular, masculine nouns (un libro - a book)
- `una` for singular, feminine nouns (una manzana - an apple)
- `unos` for plural, masculine nouns (unos libros - some books)
- `unas` for plural, feminine nouns (unas manzanas - some apples)

Note: In Spanish, the articles should match the gender and number of the nouns they modify.

## Omission of Articles

Unlike English, Spanish sometimes uses definite articles before names and uncountable nouns. For example, "La paciencia es importante" (Patience is important). However, there are instances where articles are omitted. For instance, after forms of the verb 'ser' when talking about professions, "Soy profesor" (I am a teacher).
