The imperative mood in Spanish is used to give orders or commands, make requests, or offer advice.

## Formation

In Spanish, the imperative is formed by conjugating the verb in a specific way. The conjugation changes depending on whether the command is affirmative or negative, and whether it is formal or informal.

For example, the verb "hablar" (to speak) is conjugated as follows:

- Tú: habla (speak! - affirmative), no hables (don't speak! - negative)
- Usted: hable (speak! - formal, affirmative), no hable (don't speak! - formal, negative)
- Nosotros: hablemos (let's speak! - affirmative), no hablemos (let's not speak! - negative)

## Irregular Verbs

Several verbs have irregular imperative forms, like "ser" (be), "ir" (go), "tener" (have), and "venir" (come).

For example, the command form of "ser" is "sé" in the tú form and "sea" in the usted form.
