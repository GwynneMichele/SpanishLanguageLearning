Prepositions are small words that connect and establish relationships between the different parts of a sentence. They are vital for understanding the context and nuances of what is being communicated.

Here are some common Spanish prepositions and their English equivalents:

- `a` (to, at)
- `de` (of, from)
- `en` (in, on)
- `para` (for, to, in order to)
- `por` (for, by, through, along, around)
- `con` (with)
- `sin` (without)
- `sobre` (over, about)
- `entre` (between, among)
- `hasta` (until, up to)
- `desde` (from, since)
- `contra` (against)
- `durante` (during)
- `según` (according to)

Prepositions can be tricky because their use can vary greatly between English and Spanish. It's common to find a preposition that doesn’t translate directly between the two languages, so learning the specific uses of each preposition in context is key.
