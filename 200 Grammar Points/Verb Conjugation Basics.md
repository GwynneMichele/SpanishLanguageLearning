Spanish verbs change form based on the subject (the person or thing doing the action), the tense (when the action is happening), and the mood (the attitude of the speaker towards the action). This change in form is known as conjugation.

## Regular Verbs

Spanish verbs are divided into three categories based on their infinitive ending: `-ar`, `-er`, and `-ir`. Each category has its own set of regular conjugation rules. Here's the present tense conjugation for each type:

- `AR` verbs (example: [[hablar]] - to speak)
    - yo hablo (I speak)
    - tú hablas (you speak)
    - él/ella/usted habla (he/she/you(formal) speak)
    - nosotros/nosotras hablamos (we speak)
    - vosotros/vosotras habláis (you all speak)
    - ellos/ellas/ustedes hablan (they/you all speak)
    
- `ER` verbs (example: [[comer]] - to eat)
    - yo como (I eat)
    - tú comes (you eat)
    - él/ella/usted come (he/she/you(formal) eat)
    - nosotros/nosotras comemos (we eat)
    - vosotros/vosotras coméis (you all eat)
    - ellos/ellas/ustedes comen (they/you all eat)

- `IR` verbs (example: [[vivir]] - to live)
    - yo vivo (I live)
    - tú vives (you live)
    - él/ella/usted vive (he/she/you(formal) live)
    - nosotros/nosotras vivimos (we live)
    - vosotros/vosotras vivís (you all live)
    - ellos/ellas/ustedes viven (they/you all live)

## Irregular Verbs

Some Spanish verbs have irregular conjugations. These verbs don't follow the regular conjugation patterns and have to be memorized. Examples include `ser` (to be), `ir` (to go), and `tener` (to have).
