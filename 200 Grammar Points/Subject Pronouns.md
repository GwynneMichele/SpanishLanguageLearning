Subject pronouns are used to indicate who is doing the action of the verb. Here's a list of subject pronouns in Spanish:

- `yo` (I)
- `tú` (you, singular, informal)
- `usted` (you, singular, formal)
- `él` (he)
- `ella` (she)
- `nosotros/nosotras` (we, masculine/feminine)
- `vosotros/vosotras` (you, plural, informal, mainly used in Spain)
- `ustedes` (you, plural, formal or informal, used in Latin America and formal in Spain)
- `ellos/ellas` (they, masculine/feminine)

## Points to note:

- The use of `tú` and `usted` can depend on the region, the situation, and the level of closeness between speakers. When in doubt, it's usually safer to use `usted`.

- In Spanish, subject pronouns are often omitted because the verb ending indicates who the subject is. For example, instead of saying "yo hablo" (I speak), you can just say "hablo". This is not the case when the subject is emphasized or clarified.

- Spanish distinguishes between masculine and feminine in the plural pronouns (we, you all, they). Use `nosotros` when the group is all male or mixed, and `nosotras` when the group is all female. The same goes for `vosotros/vosotras` and `ellos/ellas`.
