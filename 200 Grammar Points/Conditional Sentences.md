Conditional sentences in Spanish express hypothetical situations and their possible outcomes. They're typically composed of two parts: the condition (if clause) and the main clause (result).

## Types of Conditional Sentences

1. **Real Conditionals (First Conditional):** Used for likely or possible situations.

    Example: "Si estudias, aprobarás el examen." (If you study, you will pass the exam.)

2. **Unreal Conditionals (Second Conditional):** Used for unlikely or hypothetical situations in the present or future.

    Example: "Si tuviera dinero, viajaría por el mundo." (If I had money, I would travel the world.)

3. **Past Unreal Conditionals (Third Conditional):** Used for hypothetical situations in the past that did not happen.

    Example: "Si hubiera estudiado, habría aprobado el examen." (If I had studied, I would have passed the exam.)

## Verb Tenses in Conditional Sentences

- Real Conditionals: present tense in the if clause, future tense in the main clause
- Unreal Conditionals: imperfect subjunctive in the if clause, conditional in the main clause
