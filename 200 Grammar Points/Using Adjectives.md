Adjectives are words used to describe or modify nouns. In Spanish, they have some unique characteristics compared to English.

## Placement of Adjectives

Unlike English, where adjectives generally precede the noun they modify, Spanish adjectives usually come after the noun. 

For example:
- "Un coche r√°pido" (A fast car)
- "Una casa grande" (A big house)

There are exceptions to this rule, particularly with certain adjectives that can change meaning depending on their placement.

## Agreement of Adjectives

Spanish adjectives must agree in gender and number with the nouns they modify. This means that if the noun is feminine and plural, the adjective must be as well.

For example:
- "Una manzana roja" (A red apple)
- "Dos manzanas rojas" (Two red apples)

## Irregular Adjectives

Some adjectives in Spanish are irregular and do not follow the usual rules of agreement. These adjectives need to be memorized individually.
