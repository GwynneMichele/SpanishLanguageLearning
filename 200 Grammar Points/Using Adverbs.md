Adverbs are words used to modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. They give us more information about the manner, place, time, frequency, degree, and other circumstances of the action. 

## Formation of Adverbs

Many adverbs in Spanish are formed by adding `-mente` to the feminine singular form of the adjective.

For example:
- "rápida" (quick) becomes "rápidamente" (quickly)
- "clara" (clear) becomes "claramente" (clearly)

## Position of Adverbs

Adverbs in Spanish can be placed before or after the verb, depending on the emphasis wanted and the specific adverb. 

For example:
- "Yo leo rápidamente" (I read quickly)
- "Ella habla claramente" (She speaks clearly)

## Common Adverbs

Some commonly used Spanish adverbs include `ahora` (now), `aquí` (here), `bien` (well), `siempre` (always), and `nunca` (never).
