ChatGPT can be a helpful tool when learning a new language. Here's how you can use it to generate vocabulary lists in Spanish:

## Steps

1. **Access ChatGPT**: Visit OpenAI's website or use a platform that integrates with ChatGPT.

2. **Start a Conversation**: Initiate a chat by specifying that you want to learn Spanish. For instance, you can start with "I'm learning Spanish, and I need to generate a list of common nouns."

3. **Ask for Vocabulary Lists**: Ask ChatGPT to generate a list of words in the category you're interested in. You can request lists of common nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, interjections, and so on.  You can also ask for lists of vocabulary words for specific topics that interest you, as well as genres of fiction that you're reading/watching as part of your immersive learning.

4. **Review and Save the List**: ChatGPT should provide a list of words. Review these for accuracy and relevancy. You can then copy these words into a note in your Obsidian vault, and then begin linking and creating definition notes with the new vocabulary words.

Remember, it's crucial to regularly review and practice the words you learn. ChatGPT is a tool to assist your learning but can't replace the process of active study and usage.
